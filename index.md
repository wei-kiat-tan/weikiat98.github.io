## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m <a  style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-kiat-tan/">Wei Kiat </a>, Welcome to my Github page! I am currently a Master's student studying a Master's degree in Analytics and Visualisation (MAVI) programme at Singapore University of Social Science (SUSS). Prior to this, I pursued and graduated a Bachelor's degree of Science in Economics and Politics from University of London.

Currently, I use R as my programming language and Tableau to do data visualisations and storytelling. My R works and Tableau Public Profile can be found in the link below.
